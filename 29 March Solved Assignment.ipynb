    "Lasso Regression, also known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that is used to select and estimate the most important variables for a model while reducing the effect of less important variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors, subject to the constraint that the absolute value of the sum of the coefficients is less than or equal to a given constant, which is known as the regularization parameter or penalty parameter. This constraint forces the coefficients of the less important variables to be shrunk towards zero, resulting in a sparse model with fewer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques such as ordinary least squares regression and ridge regression, Lasso Regression has the ability to perform variable selection, meaning it can identify and exclude the irrelevant features from the model. In addition, Lasso Regression can handle high-dimensional data sets with a large number of features, where the number of features exceeds the number of observations, which can lead to overfitting."

    "One of the main advantages of Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can automatically perform variable selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. This means that the Lasso Regression model can effectively identify and exclude irrelevant or redundant features from the model, resulting in a simpler and more interpretable model with better performance on new, unseen data. This is particularly useful in cases where the dataset contains a large number of features, many of which may not be informative or relevant for the target variable. By reducing the number of features in the model, Lasso Regression can also help to reduce the risk of overfitting, which can occur when the model is too complex and captures noise in the data rather than the true underlying relationship between the features and the target variable."

    "Lasso Regression shrinks the coefficients of some independent variables towards zero, effectively eliminating them from the model. The remaining non-zero coefficients indicate the independent variables that are most important in predicting the dependent variable. Therefore, a positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, while a negative coefficient indicates a negative relationship. The larger the coefficient (in absolute terms), the stronger the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable."

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features. In fact, it is often used for feature selection in the presence of multicollinearity. Lasso Regression performs regularization by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which shrinks the coefficients of the input features towards zero. This penalty term is based on the L1 norm of the coefficients. Since the L1 norm is less tolerant to multicollinearity than the L2 norm used in Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression tends to force the coefficients of the correlated input features to be zero, effectively selecting one of them and eliminating the others. In this way, Lasso Regression can deal with multicollinearity by performing automatic feature selection."

For a given value of lambda, the Lasso Regression model is trained on the training data and tested on the testing data. The performance of the model is evaluated using a suitable metric, such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE). This process is repeated for different values of lambda, and the lambda value that gives the best performance on the testing data is chosen as the optimal value.\n",
