    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a measure of how well the regression line fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared can take values between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that none of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s), while a value of 1 indicates that all of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",

    "R-squared is calculated as:\n",

    "R-squared = 1 - (SSres / SStot)\n",
    "\n",
    "where SSres is the sum of squares of the residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable) and SStot is the total sum of squares (the sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared represents the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. In other words, it indicates how well the model fits the data. A high value of R-squared indicates that the model is a good fit to the data and that a large proportion of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s). A low value of R-squared indicates that the model does not fit the data well and that only a small proportion of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that R-squared does not indicate whether the regression coefficients are statistically significant or whether the model is a good predictor of the dependent variable in new data. Therefore, it is important to use other measures, such as p-values and cross-validation, to evaluate the statistical significance of the coefficients and the predictive accuracy of the model."

It is a measure of the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s), adjusted for the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike R-squared, which always increases as additional independent variables are added to the model, adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of independent variables that do not significantly improve the fit of the model. This is because adding more independent variables to a model can increase the R-squared value even if they do not contribute significantly to the prediction of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "In general, it is always important to report both R-squared and adjusted R-squared when reporting results from a multiple linear regression model. This is because R-squared provides an overall measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model, while adjusted R-squared provides a measure of how well the model fits the data while adjusting for the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in situations where there are multiple independent variables to consider and it is unclear which ones are truly influential in explaining the variation in the dependent variable, adjusted R-squared can be more appropriate than R-squared. This is because adjusted R-squared takes into account the fact that adding additional independent variables to the model will increase the value of R-squared even if those variables do not truly contribute to the explanation of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, adjusted R-squared can be a more conservative estimate of the true fit of the model, which is especially important when making predictions or drawing conclusions based on the model. Additionally, it can help prevent overfitting the model, which occurs when the model is too complex and fits the sample data too closely, but does not generalize well to new data."
