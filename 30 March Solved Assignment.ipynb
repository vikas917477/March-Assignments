    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the properties of both Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression. It is used to overcome the limitations of these two techniques, namely overfitting and underfitting, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the cost function is a combination of the L1 and L2 regularization terms, allowing the model to select a subset of relevant features while simultaneously shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero. The strength of each regularization term is controlled by the hyperparameters alpha and lambda, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression differs from Lasso Regression in that it can handle situations where the number of predictors is greater than the number of observations, as well as situations where the predictors are highly correlated. It also differs from Ridge Regression in that it can perform variable selection by setting some coefficients exactly equal to zero, thus producing a more interpretable model."

In this process, the dataset is split into k-folds, and the model is trained k times. Each time, a different fold is used for testing, while the remaining folds are used for training. The performance of the model is then evaluated using a performance metric such as mean squared error or R-squared. The process is repeated for different values of the regularization parameters, and the combination of values that produces the best performance is chosen as the optimal set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different methods for choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters. One common method is grid search, in which a range of values is specified for each parameter, and all possible combinations of values are tried. Another method is randomized search, in which a random sample of values is selected from each range, and the combinations of values that produce the best performance are chosen. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the size of the dataset, the number of parameters, and the computational resources available."

    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can handle both multicollinearity and high-dimensional data sets.\n",
    "2. Performs better than Lasso and Ridge regression for highly correlated independent variables.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Requires careful tuning of the regularization parameters, which can be time-consuming.\n",
