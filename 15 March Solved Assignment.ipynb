    "1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and language understanding. AI is an interdisciplinary field that includes subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and more. For example, AI is used in chatbots, self-driving cars, and image recognition systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves building algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML algorithms can automatically improve their performance by learning from the patterns in data. There are three main types of ML: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. For example, ML is used in email filtering, speech recognition, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple layers. Deep learning models can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data by processing multiple layers of nonlinear transformations. Deep learning has been particularly successful in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. For example, deep learning is used in self-driving cars, facial recognition systems, and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa."

    "1. Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with a labeled dataset, which means the data already has target variables or output variables. The algorithm learns from this dataset to predict the output variable for future data points. The goal is to find a mapping function from the input variables to the output variables. Examples of supervised learning include regression, classification, and time series forecasting.\n",

The algorithm learns from this dataset to find the underlying structure, patterns, or relationships among the variables. The goal is to find a hidden structure in the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.\n",

In this type of learning, the algorithm is provided with both labeled and unlabeled data. The algorithm learns from the labeled data to predict the output variable for the unlabeled data. The goal is to improve the performance of the algorithm by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. Examples of semi-supervised learning include semi-supervised classification, semi-supervised regression, and semi-supervised clustering.\n",

    "In machine learning, it is common to split the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to adjust its parameters such that it fits the data well. The goal is to minimize the error between the predictions made by the model and the actual values in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on data that it has not seen during the training phase. This is important to ensure that the model is not overfitting, i.e., memorizing the training data instead of learning general patterns. By evaluating the model on the testing set, we can estimate how well it will perform on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation set is used to fine-tune the model's parameters, such as the learning rate or regularization strength, in order to improve its performance. This is done by training the model on the training set, evaluating its performance on the validation set, and adjusting the parameters based on the validation results. The final model is then evaluated on the testing set to estimate its performance on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each set is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training set: It is important to have a large and representative training set to train the model effectively and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Testing set: It is important to have a testing set that is representative of the real-world data that the model will encounter. It should not be used for parameter tuning, as this can lead to overfitting.\n",

Any data point that falls outside of these clusters or has significantly different features than the rest of the data points can be considered as an anomaly or outlier.\n",

By using unsupervised learning, the company can cluster normal transactions based on features such as location, amount, time, and other transaction details.

This approach can help identify previously unknown patterns or fraud tactics, which can be used to improve fraud detection models."
