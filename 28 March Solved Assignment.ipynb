    "Ridge regression is a type of linear regression technique used to handle multicollinearity in a dataset. In ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. However, in datasets with highly correlated predictor variables, OLS regression can lead to overfitting and unstable estimates of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty term to the OLS regression objective function. This penalty term is a function of the squared magnitude of the regression coefficients, which forces them to shrink towards zero. By adding this penalty term, Ridge regression can reduce the variance in the estimates of the regression coefficients, improving the stability and generalization performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Ridge regression is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter (lambda). A higher value of lambda increases the strength of the penalty term, leading to more shrinkage of the coefficients.\n",

Then, the coefficients of the predictor variables that are shrunk towards zero can be considered less important and potentially removed from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use a variation of Ridge Regression called Lasso Regression, which has an even stronger feature selection property. In Lasso Regression, the regularization penalty is based on the absolute values of the regression coefficients, rather than their squares as in Ridge Regression. This results in some coefficients being exactly zero, effectively removing the corresponding variables from the model."

This combines the time-series modeling capabilities of ARIMA with the regularization properties of Ridge Regression to produce a more robust and accurate model.\n",
