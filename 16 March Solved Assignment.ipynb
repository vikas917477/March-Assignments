    "Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that can occur in machine learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures the noise in the data instead of the underlying pattern. This results in a model that fits the training data well but performs poorly on new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting include low accuracy and poor generalization of the model.\n",

    "To mitigate overfitting, one can use techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization: This involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to encourage simpler models.\n",
    "- Dropout: This involves randomly dropping out some nodes during training to reduce the model's dependence on specific features.\n",
    "- Early stopping: This involves stopping the training process early when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying pattern in the data. This results in a model that performs poorly on both the training and test data. The consequences of underfitting include high bias and low accuracy.\n",
    "To mitigate underfitting, one can use techniques such as:\n",

    "- Increasing the model complexity: This can involve increasing the number of parameters or adding new features to the model.\n",

    "Bias refers to the systematic error in the model, which occurs when the model is unable to capture the true underlying relationship between the input features and the target variable. A model with high bias typically oversimplifies the problem and is unable to learn from the data, leading to a high training error and low test error. In other words, a high bias model has a low capacity to fit the data.\n",

    "Variance, on the other hand, refers to the amount of variability in the model that arises from its sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. A model with high variance is typically more complex and overfits the data, leading to low training error and high test error. In other words, a high variance model has a high capacity to fit the data.\n",

    "To illustrate the difference between high bias and high variance models, let's consider the example of a polynomial regression problem with a single input feature. A high bias model would be a linear regression model, which has low flexibility and is unable to capture the underlying nonlinear relationship between the input and the target variable. A high variance model, on the other hand, would be a high-degree polynomial regression model, which has high flexibility and can fit the training data very well, but is likely to overfit and generalize poorly to new data.\n",

    "1. L1 regularization (Lasso): This technique adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which leads to some coefficients being exactly zero.
