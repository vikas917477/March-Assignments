    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two types of mathematical functions used in probability theory and statistics to describe the probabilities of different outcomes in a random process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, such as the number of heads in a coin toss or the number of red balls in a bag of colored balls. It gives the probability of each possible outcome in the discrete set of values that the variable can take. The PMF assigns a probability to each possible value of the random variable, so that the sum of all probabilities is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case of rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the random variable X, which represents the number of dots that appear on the face of the die, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",

    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, each probability is equal to 1/6, since there are six equally likely outcomes when rolling a fair die.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the PDF is used for continuous random variables, such as the height of a person or the time it takes to complete a task. It gives the relative likelihood of each possible value of the variable, as well as the likelihood of a range of values occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case of the normal distribution, which is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used in statistics. The PDF of the normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = (1 / (sigma * sqrt(2 * pi))) * exp(-(x - mu)^2 / (2 * sigma^2))\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, mu is the mean of the distribution and sigma is its standard deviation. The function f(x) gives the probability density at the point x, which represents the likelihood of observing a value in the range [x, x + dx], where dx is an infinitesimal interval. The area under the curve of the PDF between two points a and b represents the probability of observing a value in the range [a, b].\n",

    "In summary, the PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability of each possible outcome, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables and gives the likelihood of each possible value and range of values."

    "1. Central Limit Theorem: The normal distribution is used in the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sample mean of a sufficiently large sample from any distribution will follow a normal distribution. This theorem is important in statistical inference, where we use sample data to make inferences about a larger population.\n",

    "2. Heights of individuals: The heights of individuals in a population are also normally distributed, with a mean of around 5 feet 7 inches and a standard deviation of around 3 inches. This means that most people fall within a few inches of the mean height, with a smaller percentage of people being much shorter or taller.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Blood pressure: The distribution of blood pressure in a population is also approximately normal, with a mean of around 120/80 mmHg and a standard deviation of around 10 mmHg.
