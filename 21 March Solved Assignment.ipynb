    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two techniques used to transform categorical data into numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding is a technique where each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, in a dataset with three categories, \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" label encoding could assign \"red\" to 0, \"green\" to 1, and \"blue\" to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding, on the other hand, assigns a unique integer value to each category based on its order or rank. For example, if we have a dataset with three categories: \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high,\" ordinal encoding could assign \"low\" to 1, \"medium\" to 2, and \"high\" to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between ordinal encoding and label encoding is that ordinal encoding considers the order or rank of categories, while label encoding does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, ordinal encoding is preferred over label encoding when there is a natural order or ranking between the categories, such as in the example above with \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high.\" On the other hand, label encoding is often used when there is no intrinsic ordering of the categories, such as in the example with colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset with a column for education level, with categories \"high school,\" \"college,\" and \"graduate school.\" In this case, we might choose to use ordinal encoding since there is a natural order to the categories, and we can assign a higher value to the category associated with a higher level of education. On the other hand, if we have a dataset with a column for hair color, with categories \"blonde,\" \"brunette,\" and \"redhead,\" we might choose to use label encoding since there is no inherent ordering to the categories."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables into ordinal values based on their relationship with the target variable. In this technique, we first calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each unique category in the categorical variable. Then, we order the categories based on their mean or median values, with the category having the highest value assigned the highest rank and the category with the lowest value assigned the lowest rank. Finally, we replace each category with its corresponding rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset containing information about employees, including their job titles and salaries. We want to predict the salary of a new employee based on their job title. In this case, we can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to convert the job titles into ordinal values based on their relationship with the target variable, which is the salary.\n",

    "Let's say we have the following job titles and corresponding mean salaries:\n",

    "- Sales: $50,000\n",

    "We can then assign a rank to each job title based on their mean salary, with Manager being assigned the highest rank and Customer Service being assigned the lowest rank. The resulting ordinal values would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manager: 4\n",
    "- Developer: 3\n",
    "- Sales: 2\n",
    "- Customer Service: 1\n",
    "We can then use these ordinal values in our machine learning model to predict the salary of a new employee based on their job title.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might choose to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding over other encoding techniques when we have a categorical variable that has a strong relationship with the target variable, and we want to preserve that relationship in our encoded data. It is also useful when we have a large number of unique categories in the categorical variable, as it reduces the dimensionality of the data."
